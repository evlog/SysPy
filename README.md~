System Python
===============================================================================
This project is based on my PhD thesis and is related with a Python tool 
developed to ease the hardware implementation of processor-centric systems 
implemented on FGPA devices. 

Using Python our goal was to integrate under the same scripting environment all 
the required tools for hardware/software development and simulation of a 
System on Chip (SoC). SysPy also takes advantage of Python's clear and powerful 
syntax that can be used to describe hardware digital designs using Hardware 
Description Language (HDL) like syntax or in an abstract way, using functions 
to auto-generate HDL code.



The key fetures of the tool are summarized below:
