   "test_core_gen2_wrapper" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc5vlx50t, package ff1136, speed -3
WARNING:Par:465 - The PAR option, "-t" (Starting Placer Cost Table), will be disabled in the next software release when
   used in combination with MAP -timing(Perform Timing-Driven Packing and Placement) or when run with V5 or newer
   architectures.  To explore cost tables, please use the MAP option, "-t" (Starting Placer Cost Table), instead.

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to 1.050 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.64 2009-03-03".
