Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         25 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       25 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              19
      Number using O5 output only:               2
      Number using O5 and O6:                    4
  Number of route-thrus:                         1 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     7 out of   7,200    1%
    Number of occupied SLICEMs:                  0 out of   1,920    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           25
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            25 out of      25  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      25    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of      25    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  28,800    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        13 out of     480    2%

Specific Feature Utilization:

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.53

Peak Memory Usage:  345 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  26 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   19 secs
