<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="465" delta="unknown" >The PAR option, &quot;-t&quot; (Starting Placer Cost Table), will be disabled in the next software release when used in combination with MAP -timing(Perform Timing-Driven Packing and Placement) or when run with V5 or newer architectures.  To explore cost tables, please use the MAP option, &quot;-t&quot; (Starting Placer Cost Table), instead.

<msg type="info" file="Par" num="282" delta="unknown" >No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints (&quot;par -x&quot;). Place and Route will run in &quot;Performance Evaluation Mode&quot; to automatically improve the performance of all internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock. Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to &quot;std&quot;.  For best performance, set the effort level to &quot;high&quot;.
